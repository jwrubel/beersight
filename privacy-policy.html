<h2 style="text-align: center;">PRIVACY POLICY MODEL FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS</h2> 
<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Beersight (“Application”) for mobile devices. Beersight uses Machine Learning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to allow you to take a photo of a restaurant tap list with your phone, and get searchable links to the drinks on the list.</p> 
<h4><strong>Information Beersight collects and how we use it</strong></h4> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Other than photos you intentionally submit, Beersight does not collect any information about you as a user in order to use the app.</p> 
<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong></p> 
<p><em>Beersight uses third-party applications to collect aggregate, anonymous usage information about how you use the app. This information may include </em> but is not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile devices unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the Application. No personally-identifiable information is provided to third parties, and Beersight does not use any advertising services.</p> 
<p>Beersight does not leverage any device geolocation functionality for its service. Please be aware that many mobile device cameras store the latitude and longitude where a specific photo was taken as part of the metadata of the photo itself. If your mobile device includes this data in a photo you transmit to Beersight, our servers will have access to this metadata. The metadata does not identify your current location; only the location where the photo was taken. Beersight does not currently inspect this information even if it is included in a photo. If we do decide to make use of photo location metadata in the future, we will update our privacy policy to reflect this and provide notice in the application.</p>
