    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Beer Goggles Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Beer Goggles (Application) for mobile devices. Beer Goggles uses Machine Learning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to allow you to take a photo of a restaurant tap list with your phone, and get searchable links to the drinks on the list.</p>
    <h4><strong>Information Beer Goggles collects and how we use it</strong></h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>Beer Goggles collects photos you intentionally submit for processing by the application. Beer Goggles stores photos uploaded to its service and the text that is extracted from those photos. This information is used to improve our product and service, and is never shared with third parties.</p>
    <p>Beer Goggles allows users to register for an account by providing an email address or through a text message to their mobile phone number. If you create an account, Beer Goggles stores your email or phone number as part of your account data.</p>
    <p>Beer Goggles uses the <a href="" target="_blank">Google Firebase</a> service to store user-provided data. The privacy policy for Google Firebase can be found <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <p><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong></p>
    <p>Beer Goggles uses third-party applications (including, but not limited to, Google Analytics for Firebase) to collect aggregate, anonymous usage information about how you use the app. This information may include but is not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile devices unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the Application. No personally-identifiable information is provided to third parties.</p>
    <p>In order to maintain Beer Goggles as a free service, we reserve the right to include advertisements in the application.</p>
    <p>Beer Goggles does not leverage any device geolocation functionality for its service. Please be aware that many mobile device cameras store the latitude and longitude where a specific photo was taken as part of the metadata of the photo itself. If your mobile device includes this data in a photo you transmit to Beer Goggles, our servers will have access to this metadata. The metadata does not identify your current location; only the location where the photo was taken. Beer Goggles does not currently inspect this information even if it is included in a photo. If we do decide to make use of photo location metadata in the future, we will update our privacy policy to reflect this and provide notice in the application.</p>
    <p>Legal Requirements</p>
    <p>We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
    <ul>
     <li> <p>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</p> </li>
     <li> <p>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</p> </li>
     <li> <p>With trusted service providers who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement. Third parties that are used by Beer Goggles will be disclosed in this privacy policy.</p> </li>
     <li> <p>if the Beer Goggles app is sold to a third party, you will be notified via an app update and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices you may have regarding this information.</p> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
    <p><strong>Children</strong></p>
    <p>Due to its subject matter, Beer Goggles should not be used by children under the age of 13. Beer Goggles is offered through app stores or digital marketplaces with an age-restriction, where such measures are provided by the marketplace. This means that in order to download the app, the device owner must be able to verify they are over the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and find that your child under the age of 13 has installed Beer Goggles, you should uninstall the app.</p>
    <h4><strong>Changes</strong></h4>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the app to display a prominent link to the new policy. Your continued use of Beer Goggles after having been notified of an updated Privacy Policy is considered approval of all changes.</p>
